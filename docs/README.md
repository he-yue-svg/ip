# Introduction
Leo is a simple command-line chatbot for managing tasks. It supports three types:
To-dos: tasks without dates.
Deadlines: tasks to finish by a certain date.
Events: activities with a start and end date.

Tasks are saved automatically to a local file and reloaded each time you run Leo.

# Adding Tasks
Deadline: deadline <description> /by <yyyy-mm-dd>
Example: 
```
deadline finish assignment /by 2025-09-30
[D][ ] finish assignment (by: 2025-09-30)
```

Event: event <description> /from <yyyy-mm-dd> /to <yyyy-mm-dd>
Example:
```
event project meeting /from 2025-09-20 /to 2025-09-20
[E][ ] project meeting (from: 2025-09-20 to: 2025-09-20)
```

To-do: todo <description>
Example: 
```
todo read a book
[T][ ] read a book
```
